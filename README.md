The project involves creating an efficient Blood Bank Online System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Golang, MongoDB, and Docker on Google Cloud Platform.
The system allows donors to submit details online, which are stored centrally, and those in need can quickly check blood availability.
The user-friendly interface facilitates easy donor registration and blood requests, reducing paperwork and enhancing communication.
The deployment on Google Cloud ensures broad accessibility, and the primary aim is to provide swift access to required blood groups, ultimately saving lives.
